# Transform Your Power Pages Development: Why Local Development is the Future

## The Problem with Traditional Power Pages Development

Are you tired of the slow, frustrating development cycle of Power Pages? If you're working on Power Pages projects, you know the pain:

- **Endless Deploy Cycles**: Every small change requires a full deployment, turning a 5-minute fix into a 30-minute wait.
- **No Version Control**: Stuck with a single online version with no proper Git support, making collaboration a nightmare.
- **Limited AI Integration**: Missing out on the latest AI-powered development tools that could accelerate your workflow.
- **Team Collaboration Chaos**: Need to test different features? You'll need separate Power Pages environments for each version.
